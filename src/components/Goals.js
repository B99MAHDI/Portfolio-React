                    I am a junior Systems engineer (Devops engineer). I am passionate about computer science, and most interested in systems administration and operations, equally in algorithms and data structures.            
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Moreover, I love programming, and I wrote a good amount of code in Python, C/C++, Go, PHP, and javascript (Node too) â€¦ Not to mention that I am always open to learn new programming concepts and paradigms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Besides computer science, I am interested in startups, education, and new technologies. I am also a FOSS advocate and a blogger.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I love nature, food, and travel and if it wasn't for computer science, I would have been a world traveling chef, who writes movie reviews from time to time.
